This project is an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed for Diabetes Prediction.  
It integrates data engineering, machine learning, experiment tracking, deployment, and monitoring into one ecosystem.  
The workflow leverages Dockerized databases (MariaDB ColumnStore, Redis), Airflow for orchestration, Great Expectations for data validation, MLflow for experiment tracking, and Evidently AI for monitoring data and concept drift.  
🚀 MLOps Project – Diabetes Prediction
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready MLOps workflow for training, validating, deploying, and monitoring a machine learning model for Diabetes Prediction.

It integrates:

Conda for environment management

MariaDB ColumnStore + Redis for data & caching

Airflow for orchestration

Great Expectations for data quality validation

MLflow for experiment tracking

Evidently AI for monitoring data drift & concept drift

FastAPI and Streamlit for serving predictions

🛠️ Prerequisites

Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/Ashokkoirala10/mlops_diabetes_prediction.git
cd mlops_diabetes_prediction/mlops_project


Install Docker (for DB & Redis)

# Pull MariaDB ColumnStore
docker pull mariadb/columnstore

# Pull Redis
docker pull redis


Install Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)

⚙️ Setup Environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mlops_env

🌬️ Airflow Setup

Initialize Airflow DB:

airflow db init


Create Admin user:

airflow users create \
  --username admin \
  --firstname First \
  --lastname Last \
  --role Admin \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --password admin

⚠️ Note

Update hardcoded paths in the DAG file where indicated by comments.

Example:

BASE_DIR = "/home/ashok/mlops_project"  # Change to your absolute path
DB_CONN = "mysql+pymysql://<username>:<password>@localhost:3306/diabetes_ml"

✅ Great Expectations Setup

If not initialized:

great_expectations init

📊 Monitoring (Data Drift & Concept Drift)

In monitoring DAG/config files, update:

DB_URL = "mysql+pymysql://<username>:<password>@localhost:3306/diabetes_ml"

REPORT_DIR = Path("/your/path/mlops_project/reports/evidently/concept_drift")
REPORT_DIR = Path("/your/path/mlops_project/reports/evidently/data_drift")

⚡ FastAPI Setup

Update DB connection credentials with your username/password.

Update directory paths as per your system.

Run FastAPI:

uvicorn app:app --reload


Access: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

🎨 Streamlit Setup

In streamlit_app.py, update the file paths (comments provided in code).

Run Streamlit:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

📊 MLflow Tracking

Start MLflow UI:

mlflow ui


Access MLflow: http://127.0.0.1:5000

📈 Features

Airflow DAGs orchestrating ingestion, validation, training, monitoring

Great Expectations for schema & data checks

Evidently reports for monitoring data/concept drift

FastAPI for REST API prediction service

Streamlit for interactive predictions

MLflow for experiment tracking
